# User Authentication and Authorization with Bearer Token

This project is a Node.js-based application that implements user authentication and authorization using Bearer tokens. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and utilizes Express.js, Mongoose (MongoDB), and JWT for token-based authentication.

## Project Overview

This application provides a secure user registration and login system using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for token-based authentication. The user data is stored in a MongoDB database, and the application follows the MVC architecture for better separation of concerns. The application also includes a protected route for fetching user information, accessible only with a valid JWT.

## Tech Stack
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime used for server-side development.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for Node.js to build RESTful APIs.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB ODM for modeling application data.
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken)**: Used to generate and verify Bearer tokens for secure authentication.
- **Postman**: For API testing and documentation.


## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can register with `username`, `email`, `password`, and `role`.
- **Password Hashing**: User passwords are hashed using `bcrypt` before saving them to the database.
- **User Login**: Users can log in with their email and password. A JWT is returned upon successful login.
- **JWT Authentication**: JWTs are used to authenticate requests. A middleware function verifies the token and attaches user information to the request object.
- **Protected Routes**: A protected route for fetching user information, accessible only by providing a valid JWT.
- **API Documentation**: Postman collection for testing and sample API requests.
